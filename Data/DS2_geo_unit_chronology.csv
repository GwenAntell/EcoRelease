He suggested that the Tamiami Frm may underlie the Caloosahatchee or the Ft. Thompson Frms. Missimer (1993) defined 9 or more members of the Tamiami Frm; however, correlation among them is problematic. These 9 units can be mapped on the basis of dominant lithology in southwest FL, including: the Pinecrest Sand Member, the unnamed limestone facies, the Golden Gate Reef Member (of Meeder 1987), the Bonita Springs Marl Member (of Missimer 1984), the HYOTISSA facies, the Ochopee Limestone Member, the sand facies, the Buckingham Limestone Member, and the tan clay and sand facies. Only 1 to 4 of these occur in a vertical stratigraphic section at any given locality. In contrast to Missimer (1990, 1993), Hunter (1968) indicated the Pinecrest Sand, Ochopee Limestone and Buckingham Limestone were lateral equivalents. Missimer (1990), on the other hand, indicated the Buckingham Limestone is the lowermost facies and is probably equivalent in age to the clay and sand facies. The Tamiami Frm additionally has been broken into at least three other members (Fruitville, Golden Gate Reef, and Bonita Springs Marl, cited youngest to oldest) by Meeder (1987) and Petuch and Roberts (2007), but these remain controversial. Meeder (1987) did not formally define the Golden Gate Reef Member in terms of the stratigraphy and relationships with other major lithological units, and Missimer (1984) only informally suggested the Bonita Springs Marl Member. Much controversy and confusion surrounds the surface and near-surface deposits of southern Florida, especially the Tamiami Frm. This is for a variety of reasons, see Jones et al (1991) and Scott (1992) for details. Based on the sequence stratigraphic framework of Zullo and Harris (1992) at the APAC and SMR Pits, the authors concluded that Petuch's Units 0-1 belong to the Caloosahatchee Frm and Units 2-11 were within the Tamiami Frm. Units 2-9 were divided into the upper Tamiami Frm, and Units 10-11 were within the lower Tamiami Frm. Further subdivision placed Units 2-3 into the upper Pinecrest Beds and Units 4-9 into the lower Pinecrest Beds. Petuch and Drolshagen (2011), however, now consider Units 2-4 to belong to the Fruitville Member (Tamiami Frm), Units 5-9 to belong to the Pinecrest Member (Tamiami Frm), Unit 10 to belong to the Buckingham Member (Tamiami Frm) and Unit 11 to be the Sarasota Member (Murdock Station Frm).","Missimer (1993) cited the Frm as 4.2-2.8 Ma, while Campbell and Campbell (1995) indicated the Tamiami Limestone is 4-3.8 Ma; Petuch and Roberts (2007) placed the Tamiami Frm older than 2.1 Ma; Williams et al (2000) and Knowles et al (2009) also cited the Tamiami Formation as older, from 5.3-4.3 Ma; Kolbe et al (2011) indicated an age of 4.3-2.5 Ma in parts of both NE and S Florida; Scott (2011) placed an older bottom age for the Tamiami at 5.3 Ma.","The lower Tamiami and lower Pinecrest Beds are correlated with the Jackson Bluff Frm (Zullo and Harris 1992; Zullo and Portell 1993) [note that the lower Tamiami Frm, depending on the definition, does not correlate with the Jackson Bluff Frm in this compilation].",

The authors also subdivided the units into the upper Pinecrest Beds (Units 2 and 3) and lower Pinecrest Beds (Units 4 through 9). Petuch's Unit 10 and 11 were placed into the lower Tamiami Formation. *Indicates these units are no longer included in the Pinecrest (Unit 10 and 11) (Portell et al 2012). ","Bender (1972, 1973) found a date of 3.9-3.5 Ma for the Pinecrest, but the location within the section was not specified. Cronin (1991) cited that the entire Pinecrest spans from 4.5-1.8 Ma. The older dates cited by these authors probably reflect the fact that the authors included lower units (Units 10 and 11) in their estimation, which are now removed from the Pinecrest sensu Zullo and Harris (1992). Campbell and Campbell (1995) cited an age of 3.0-2.8 Ma for Beds 3-1; Allmon et al (1996a,b) cited a slightly younger top age of 2.5-2.0 Ma (Matuyama Chron). Cronin (1991) indicated an age of 3.5-3.0 Ma for Beds 10-5. Campbell and Campbell (1995) cited an age of 3.3-3.1 Ma for the ""middle beds"" of the Pinecrest. Knowles et al (2009) and Williams et al (2009) have the Pinecrest Beds 10-5 at ~3.7-3.5 Ma. Knowles et al (2009) and Williams et al (2009) placed beds 11-10 at 4.2-3.9 Ma, suggesting the authors did not revise the age of interval zone M6. Campbell and Campbell (2005) placed the age at 3.75-3.55 Ma for Bed 10 (= Bed 11?). Missimer (2001a) indicated the ""Pinecrest"" is 3.22-2.15 Ma; however, when Beds 10 and 11 are removed from traditional definitions of the ""Pinecrest"", this age range seems to match the ages of the sequences fairly well; Missimer and Wise (2012) indicated the Pinecrest is 3-2 Ma.","Units 4-2, the ""upper Pinecrest,"" are correlated with the Chowan River Frm (VA and Carolinas) (Jones et al 1991; Dowsett and Cronin 1996; Williams et al 2009).

Florida,Intracoastal,,2.6,5.54,Huddlestun (pers comm 2013),"The distinction between the Jackson Bluff and Intracoastal Frms is not always clear, although Portell (pers comm 2013) indicated the units can be easily distinguished because the Jackson Bluff Frm is primarily of clastic lithologically, while the Intracoastal Frm is primarily carbonate. Scott (2011) indicated the Intracoastal Frm is above the Jackson Bluff Frm in his stratigraphic chart, but Schmidt and Clark (1980) and Otvos (1988) indicated the unit underlies or interfingers with the Jackson Bluff Frm, and Means (pers comm 2013) confirmed this relationship for at least a pit just north of Carrabelle. Means and Portell (pers comm 2013) have never seen the Intracoastal overlying the Jackson Bluff Frm. Huddlestun (pers comm 2013), however, suggested the Intracoastal, Jackson Bluff, Citronelle, and Miccosukee Frms are all correlative: the Citronelle/Miccosukee Frms are a shore/shoreface deposit or lithofacies, whereas the Jackson Bluff Frm is an offshore, shelf bottom deposit or lithofacies. The Intracoastal Frm represents a farther offshore deposit or lithofacies where only minor siliciclastics are present but may dominate in some beds (the siliciclastics having been deposited closer to shore). According to Huddlestun (pers comm 2013), the Jackson Bluff Frm is fully encompassed within the Intracoastal Frm. ","The age cited for the Frm is variable: unit has been cited as Miocene and as young as 1.6 Ma. Donoghue (1992), Locker and Doyle (1992), and Scott (1992) cited a Middle Miocene to Late Pliocene age for the unit [Donoghue (1992) indicated the Chipola Frm sits above the Intracoastal Frm, but this relationship does not match most other publications, which placed the Chipola Frm in the Middle Miocene. Portell (pers comm 2013) indicated no cores or exposures are found where the Intracoastal Frm sits below the Chipola Frm. Rupert (1990) indicated that ""Chipola-like"" sediments are found above the Intracoastal Frm in Gulf County, which may be the root of some of the confusion]. Others suggest a significantly younger age; e.g., Clark and Wright (1979) placed the unit within the Globorotalia margaritae zone and the older G. fohsi fohsi zone, which represent an age of 4.4-3.8 Ma for the G. margaritae zone in the updated Berggren Zone scheme of Wade et al (2011). Otvos (1998) cited a younger top age of 1.6 Ma, as did Scott (2011), who indicated the Frm is within zone PL3-5 (~3.8-2.2).

Huddlestun (pers comm 2013) indicated the relationship between the Satilla Frm and the Princess Anne, Silver Bluff and Pamlico terraces is still unclear. Portell (pers comm 2013) indicated the units mapped as ""Satilla Frm"" in NE Florida were based on lithology. Parker and Cooke (1944) also indicated the unit is present in NE Florida and this was accepted by Huddlestun (1988). The Plio-Pleistocene sediments in GA and SC were onlap, transgressive sections and lacked embayments (Markewich, pers comm 2013). The Pleistocene material up to 25 m looks very similar, which is why Huddlestun (1988), using a lithostratigraphic framework, placed all units within the Satilla Frm. The framework of Huddlestun (1988) is adopted here, but work is only beginning to tease apart the complexities of the region, and this current framework is used for illustrative purposes only. ","The Prairie Frm (135-60 Ka) (Mateo 2005; Otvos 2005, 2009; Shen et al 2008); Biloxi Frm (132-116 Ka) (Otvos 2005, 2009, 2013); and Gulfport Frm (132-118 Ka) (Otvos 2013) are not valid formations according to the Florida Geological Survey (Means, pers comm 2013).

There have been varying interpretations of Pleistocene stratigraphy of GA and southern South Carolina: see chart summarizing relationships in Markewich et al (2013). Definition of formations depends on whether one takes a morphostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic or biostratigraphic interpretation. Huddlestun's (1988) framework (here adopted) does not define units on morphological features, as does Cooke (1936, 1943) or Hoyte and Hails (1974).

However, younger dates for correlative sediments of the Socastee and Neuse Frms suggest that the age of the Flanner Beach Frm may be younger, around the Sangamon Interglacial (~125-75 Ka), which Phillips (1995) has cited as an age for the Frm. Denison et al (1993) cited a mid-Pleistocene age for lower Croatan sediments, but also indicated a possible age of 1.2-0.8 Ma; this older age could result from fact that the Croatan Frm = James City Frm, as the name has been in flux.

These authors indicated that McCartan et al (1982) lumped DuBar's Socastee and Canepatch Frms together under the name ""Socastee"" and assigned the older ""Canepatch"" to deposits of an older unit. Muhs et al (2003) indicated the dates of Hollin and Hearty (1990) would be consistent with aminostratigraphic comparison with the Sea Islands VLPG data.","The unit unconformably overlies the Bear Bluff or Waccamaw Frms, and unconformably underlies the Socastee Frm (DuBar 1974); the unit is correlative with the Ladson Frm near Charleston; Lyons (1991) indicated that the Ft.

Campbell and Campbell (1995) similarly argued that the Bear Bluff stratotype is pre-Natural Well Duplin Frm in age, which is contrary to other stratigraphic opinions, and is similar to the upper Goose Creek Limestone.
